# Multictrl
 
Tired of entering commands everytime you want healbot or other addons to start or stop?  Use this to initialze your addons for alts or main and just execute with 1 command.

Using IPC now, don't require entering any alt's names.

Also included is loading addons/commands for Quetz farming.
